# graphQL Book Search

### Description

This project was made to explore the use of the MERN stack when creating a web application. I used Mongoose and MongoDB for the database backend, connecting to Mongo Atlas using a graphQL style api and syntax. Express was used for the server backend along with an apollo server to process requests. The frontend was created using react and the create-react-app command. This allowed for rapid development of the app, making iteration much easier. Finally node was used as the buildpack for live deployment to Heroku. I learned how to connect a front and backend in a MERN stack, as well as how to convert a REST api to a graphQL api. This app should help to showcase my full stack skills to potential employers.

### Usage

Navigate to the live deployment link and be greeted with a homepage asking you to search for a book. When you search a title before logging in, you will see search results with no option to save a book. When you click login at the top right, a modal will appear prompting you to either log in or sign up. After comfirming your logged in status, the option to save search books will appear. When you save a book, it will appear under your saved books tab. In this tab saved books can then be deleted, and they will be removed from the page.
